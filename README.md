# Introduction

The **Standalone Windows Executable Version of Python App Bundle Shield** is a dedicated Windows application designed to help developers create **standalone protected applications** and executable files from Python scripts of varying complexity. Prepared specifically for Windows using the [Python App Bundle Shield](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/python-app-bundle-shield), this version is based on **Python 3.8.10** and supports both **32-bit** and **64-bit** systems running **Windows 7 and newer**.

Key benefits of using this Windows application include:

- **Out-of-the-Box Functionality**: Works on Windows systems without requiring Python to be installed.
- **Widest Compatibility**: Supports older Windows versions, including 32-bit Windows 7 systems.
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides advanced protection and code security measures for your applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple graphical user interface for easy packaging of Python scripts into executables.

This tool is ideal for developers who need to distribute Python applications to Windows users in a secure and standalone executable format.

# Key Features

1. **Standalone Executable**: The application is a standalone executable that includes all dependencies, allowing it to run on Windows systems without Python installed.

2. **Wide Compatibility**: Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems from Windows 7 and newer, ensuring your applications can run on a broad range of machines.

3. **Based on Python 3.8.10**: Utilizes Python 3.8.10, providing compatibility with a wide range of Python scripts and libraries.

4. **Secure Packaging of Python Scripts**: Converts Python source files (`.py`) and compiled files (`.pyc`) into standalone executables with enhanced code protection.

5. **Embedding Python Runtime**: Optionally embeds the full Python runtime environment and all necessary dependencies into the executable.

6. **Code Obfuscation and Encryption**: Applies multi-level protection with dynamic encryption and obfuscation techniques to enhance code security.

7. **Integration with Alpha Beta Network Tools**: Seamlessly integrates with other Alpha Beta Network tools for advanced code protection and licensing options.

8. **Easy to Use**: Features a straightforward graphical user interface that simplifies the process of creating secure executable files.

# System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or newer (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions).
- **Architecture**: Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- **Disk Space**: Sufficient disk space to store the application and generated executables.
- **Permissions**: Administrator privileges may be required for certain operations.

**Note**: No separate installation of Python is required on the target system to run the application or the executables it creates.

# Installation

## Download

Download the latest release of the **Standalone Windows Executable Version of Python App Bundle Shield** from the GitHub Releases section:

- **Repository**: [python-app-bundle-shield-windows-standalone](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/python-app-bundle-shield-windows-standalone)
- **Releases**: Navigate to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/python-app-bundle-shield-windows-standalone/releases
) section and download the appropriate version for your system.

## Running the Application

After downloading:

1. **Extract the Archive**: If the application is provided in a compressed format (e.g., `.zip`), extract it to a desired location on your computer.

2. **Run the Executable**: Double-click on `python_app_bundle_shield.exe` to launch the application.

   - **No Installation Required**: The application is portable and does not require installation. You can run it directly from the extracted folder.

**Security Warning**:

- Since the application is an executable downloaded from the internet, Windows may display a security warning. If prompted, confirm that you want to run the application.

# User Interface Overview

The application features a user-friendly graphical interface with the following components:

- **File Selection**: Use the **Browse** button to select the Python script (`.py` or `.pyc`) you wish to package.

- **Options**:
  - **Embed Full Python Runtime**: Includes the full Python environment and all installed `pip` packages in the executable.
  - **Disable Console Window**: Hides the console window when running the application (useful for GUI applications).
  - **Create a One-File Bundled Executable**: Packages everything into a single executable file for ease of distribution.

- **Additional Modules**: Specify any additional modules (comma-separated) that need to be included in the build.

- **Progress Display**: Shows real-time progress of the packaging process.

- **Messages**: Displays logs and messages to help you monitor the process and diagnose issues.

# Usage Instructions

## Basic Packaging of a Source File

To package a Python source file into an executable:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `python_app_bundle_shield.exe`.

2. **Select Your Python File**:
   - Click on the **Browse** button.
   - Navigate to your Python script (`.py` file) and select it.

3. **Configure Options** (optional):
   - Enable or disable options based on your needs.

4. **Start Packaging**:
   - Click on the **Start** button.
   - The application will begin packaging your script into an executable.

5. **Output**:
   - The executable file will be created in the `dist` directory within the application folder.
   - The output executable will have enhanced protection and can be distributed to users.

## Packaging with Full Python Runtime

If your script uses external modules or packages installed via `pip`, or if you require the executable to run on systems without Python installed:

1. **Select Your Python File**: As above.

2. **Enable "Embed Full Python Runtime"**:
   - Check the **Embed Full Python Runtime** option.

3. **Specify Additional Modules** (if needed):
   - If your script uses modules that are not automatically detected, list them (comma-separated) in the **Additional Modules** field.

4. **Start Packaging**:
   - Click **Start** to create the executable with the full Python runtime embedded.

## Packaging with Cloud-Protected Scripts

When packaging scripts protected by Alpha Beta Network cloud tools:

1. **Obtain Protected Script**:
   - Use tools like [Python Obfuscator Online](https://obfuscator.alphabetanet.com/) to protect your script.

2. **Select Your Protected Python File**:
   - Choose the protected `.py` file.

3. **Enable "Embed Full Python Runtime"**:
   - This ensures compatibility with the cloud protection mechanisms.

4. **Start Packaging**:
   - Click **Start** to create the executable.

**Note**: For scripts that rely on internet connectivity or cloud services, ensure that the target systems have internet access if required.

# Examples

An example of practical use has been created using this Windows application:

- **Project**: [System Hardware ID Generator](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/system-hardware-id-generator)
- **Executable**: [system_hardware_id_generator.exe](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/system-hardware-id-generator/blob/main/system_hardware_id_generator.exe)

**Features of the Example Executable**:

- Supports all Windows versions from Windows 7 and newer.
- Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- Created using **Python App Bundle Shield v1.3 GUI**.
- Features enhanced protection and code security measures.

This example demonstrates the application’s capability to produce standalone executables that are widely compatible and secure.

# Recommendations and Best Practices

- **Test on Target Systems**: Always test the generated executable on the target Windows systems to ensure compatibility.

- **Use Separate Python Environments**: When embedding the full Python runtime, use a clean environment with only the necessary packages installed to minimize the executable size.

- **Handle External Dependencies**: If your script uses external applications or resources, ensure they are included or accessible on the target system.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Do not package malicious or untrusted scripts.
  - Be cautious with scripts that require elevated privileges.

- **Legal Compliance**:
  - Ensure you have the rights to distribute any third-party libraries included in your executable.

# Integration with Alpha Beta Network Tools
